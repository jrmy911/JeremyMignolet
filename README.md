### Hello there! 🏃‍♂️

Here's a little bit about me:
* Currently working at [Piros](https://www.piros.be), a Red Hat Premium Partner 🔴
* Loves everything related to DevOps and wants to master the concepts!
* Hybrid athlete combining strength training with running. 🏋️‍♂️

My main technology stack:
* Python and bash for scripting 🐍
* I like to deploy cloud resources using Terraform 🚀
* My main OS of choice is MacOS 👨‍💻

When possible I like to contribute to open-source projects, so feel free to check the repo's I've been working on.

See you!
